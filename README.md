# 🌐 Diego Estrada — Personal Web Playground
Live site ➜ https://daestrada911-dot.github.io/me/

A lightweight space where I ship small web projects fast and practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built and iterated in VS Code, deployed with GitHub Pages.

## ✨ What’s inside
- **Hello World / Getting to Know Each Other** — my first page with playful UI touches.
- **Class Project Proposal** — `index.html` with an H1 of “Class Project Proposal”.
- **Matchmaker: Diego’s Edition** — a fun compatibility web app (sliders, scoring, thresholds).
- **Room to Grow** — quick links and sections for future labs, notes, and demos.

> Goal: keep everything simple, fast, and clean while I level up my web fundamentals and cybersecurity mindset.

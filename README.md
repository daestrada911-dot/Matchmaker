# 🧩 Matchmaker for the Web  

**Author:** Diego Estrada  

This project was created as part of my web development coursework at Lewis University. The goal of this assignment was to build a fully functional **Matchmaker web app** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app asks five questions that measure compatibility and calculates how close someone’s answers are to my “ideal match.”  

This version focused on improving structure, design, and logic — including interactive JavaScript for scoring, clean layout using CSS, and clear HTML formatting. I also validated the code through W3C and tested it across browsers to ensure functionality and accessibility.
